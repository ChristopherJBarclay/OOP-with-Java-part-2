    Object-Oriented Programming with Java, part 2 

      University of Helsinki, Finland

This course has taught me intermediate level Java programming, as well as more advanced core Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The course is the last of a two semester line of classes from the University of Helsinki, Finland's computer science degree program. This, combined with the first part of the course (which I have also uploaded to my GitHub) is the first year of computer science classes for CS majors.

I began this course in July of 2017. I discontinued progress on this course in order to focus 100% of my efforts on Web Development in October of 2017.
